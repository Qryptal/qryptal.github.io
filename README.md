### Security and Privacy
Qryptal helps to make documents secure, tamper proof and easily verifiable by cryptographically generating and placing a digitally signed QR code incorporating the details to be secured. Each code is digitally signed by the private key of the issuing organisation. The App uses the organisation's public key to instantly validate on the mobile device itself.

This helps to maintain the security and privacy for all concerned - the document holder, the verifier and the generator of the information.

Qryptal multi-stage pipeline compression and PKI digital signing framework helps generate a small size QR code image for given amount of information while maintaining high levels of data integrity.
